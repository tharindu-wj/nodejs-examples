# Async Performance
This example shows how to write `async/await` in an efficient way. There are two files named `slow.js` and `fast.js`. slow.js file demonstrates how to approach in unefficient way and fast.js demonstrates demonstrate how to approach in an efficient way.

### Commands
* `npm install`
* `npm run slow` - this will execute the bad async/await (slow.js)
* `npm run fast` - this will execute good async/await (fast.js)

You can easily see time difference between these two code executions.
